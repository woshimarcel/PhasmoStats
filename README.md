<h2><br>What is PhasmoStats?</h2>
PhasmoStats is an application for Phasmophobia nerds, professionals, casuals, newbies and everything inbetween.
<br>Originally it was only supposed to display some interesting statistics not visible in the game.
<br>Now it's not only a small statistics-tab, but also a wiki for fast information access.

<h2><br>Clarification</h2>
The original save file is read, decrypted, and saved into a <b>new</b> file to prevent issues and avoid decrypting every time.
This program does <b>NOT</b> modify the original save file (doing so is a bannable offense).

<h2><br>What Stats can I look at?</h2>
Some statistics in the app are also inside Phasmophobia.
<br>The really interesting ones are only available in this app. This includes how often you've encountered and died to each ghost, visited each map and more!
<br>But there are many calculated stats, too. For example your chance to encounter each ghost (total cases divided by encounters by that ghost) or visited each map in percent.
<br>You can see some images in <a href=#stats-page>Stats Pages</a>.

<h2><br>Wiki? What?</h2>
Exactly. It's pretty much just the <a href="https://phasmophobia.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page">Unoffical Phasmophobia Fandom<a/> <b>but better</b> (I hope, I like it tho). 
<br>I wanted to add something not just interesting, but also useful for everyone. The wiki should have all abilities, inabilities and behaviours of each ghost type. If not, sorry!
<br>Each wiki page for ghost types also have their evidence included - for extra detail, they each have their own text style (the evidences)!
<br>You can see some images in <a href=#wiki-page>Wiki</a>.
